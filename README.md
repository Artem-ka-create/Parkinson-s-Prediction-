2.3 Prediction of the result based on the entered parameters for selected models.

2.4 Use of machine learning

2.5 Python

Mentor: Ing. Matej Gazda

All information will be regularly updated to show the progress of this project___________________________

1.Creat a logical part of this project on python tnanks numpy,pandas and scikit learn modules

2.Frontend is done at the master branch

3.Now prediction is 95%

4.Was created a lot of new functions. Added new functions. 6 models and 2 methods of prediction. It is fully finished web application

requirements.txt has a list of all uploaded modules with actual versions
