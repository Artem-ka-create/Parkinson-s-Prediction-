                                Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. 
                                Symptoms start gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. 
                                Tremors are common, but the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement.

                            In Parkinson's disease, certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain gradually break down or die. 
                            Many of the symptoms are due to a loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger 
                            in your brain called dopamine. When dopamine levels decrease, 
                            it causes abnormal brain activity, leading to impaired movement and o
                            ther symptoms of Parkinson's disease.<br><br>

                            The cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but several factors appear to play a role, including:<br><br>
                            
                            <b>• Genes</b>. Researchers have identified specific genetic mutations that can cause Parkinson's disease. But these are uncommon except in rare cases with many family members affected by Parkinson's disease.<br><br>


                            <b> Environmental triggers</b>. Exposure to certain toxins or environmental factors may increase the risk of later Parkinson's disease, but the risk is relatively small.<br><br>


                            
                            <b>• The presence of Lewy bodies</b>. Clumps of specific substances within brain cells are microscopic markers of Parkinson's disease. <br><br>

                            <b>• Alpha-synuclein found within Lewy bodies</b>. Although many substances are found within Lewy bodies, scientists believe an important one is the natural and widespread protein called alpha-synuclein (a-synuclein).

                            Risk factors for Parkinson's disease include:<br><br>

                           <b>•Age</b>. Young adults rarely experience Parkinson's disease. It ordinarily begins in middle or late life, and the risk increases with age. People usually develop the disease around age 60 or older.<br><br>
                           <b>•Heredity</b>. Having a close relative with Parkinson's disease increases the chances that you'll develop the disease. However, your risks are still small unless you have many relatives in your family with Parkinson's disease.<br><br>
                            <b>•Sex</b>. Men are more likely to develop Parkinson's disease than are women.<br><br>

                            <b>•Exposure to toxins</b>. Ongoing exposure to herbicides and pesticides may slightly increase your risk of Parkinson's disease.

                            Parkinson's disease is often accompanied by these additional problems, which may be treatable:<br><br>
                            
                            <b>•Thinking difficulties</b>. You may experience cognitive problems (dementia) and thinking difficulties. These usually occur in the later stages of Parkinson's disease. Such cognitive problems aren't very responsive to medications.<br>
                                <b>•Depression and emotional changes</b>.. You may experience depression, sometimes in the very early stages. Receiving treatment for depression can make it easier to handle the other challenges of Parkinson's disease.
                            <br><br>
                            You may also experience other emotional changes, such as fear, anxiety or loss of motivation. Doctors may give you medications to treat these symptoms.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>•Swallowing problems</b>. You may develop difficulties with swallowing as your condition progresses. Saliva may accumulate in your mouth due to slowed swallowing, leading to drooling.<br>
                            <b>•Chewing and eating problems</b>. Late-stage Parkinson's disease affects the muscles in your mouth, making chewing difficult. This can lead to choking and poor nutrition.<br>
                                <b>•Sleep problems and sleep disorders</b>. People with Parkinson's disease often have sleep problems, including waking up frequently throughout the night, waking up early or falling asleep during the day.<br><br>
                            
                            People may also experience rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, which involves acting out your dreams. Medications may help your sleep problems.<br>
                            Bladder problems. Parkinson's disease may cause bladder problems, including being unable to control urine or having difficulty urinating.<br><br>
                            <b>•Constipation</b>. Many people with Parkinson's disease develop constipation, mainly due to a slower digestive tract.<br>
                            You may also experience:<br>
                            <b>•Blood pressure changes</b>. You may feel dizzy or lightheaded when you stand due to a sudden drop in blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension).<br>

                            <b>•Smell dysfunction</b>. You may experience problems with your sense of smell. You may have difficulty identifying certain odors or the difference between odors.<br>

                            <b>•Fatigue</b>. Many people with Parkinson's disease lose energy and experience fatigue, especially later in the day. The cause isn't always known.<br>

                            <b>•Pain</b>. Some people with Parkinson's disease experience pain, either in specific areas of their bodies or throughout their bodies.<br>

                            <b>•Sexual dysfunction</b>. Some people with Parkinson's disease notice a decrease in sexual desire or performance.
